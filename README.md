# CaptchaTool
Expandable captcha solver.

This tool is likely deprecated and mostly unfinished. Originally it was used for solving ReCaptcha challenges locally on a machine, and being able to use those solved tokens immediately in other multi-threaded scraping/automation programs.

It was designed to replace/assist solutions such as 2Captcha, which cannot provide solutions in a timely mannner.
